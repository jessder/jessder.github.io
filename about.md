"Collaborative Disagreement" refers to a process that any group of people can
use to arrive at better decisions than any individual could alone.
The idea is to _collaborate_, in the sense that you are all working toward
the common goal of learning where your current ideas fall short,
while boldly _disagreeing_ with each other when your perceptions and insights
do not align.
To quote Goethe,

> True friendship manifests itself denying
> at the right time, and love will often grant
> a harmful good when it heeds more the will
> of the demanding one than his well-being.

In other words, the kindest thing one can do is sometimes to point out where
your friend has fallen short.

The spirit of this blog is to fearlessly explore ideas, wherever they originate,
and by considering them to try to wander closer to the truth.
I will tend to avoid advocating any particular ideology or political movement,
because both good and bad ideas and motives come from all of them
and noone should be limited by any "loyalty to the tribe."
At the same time, I will often be opinionated, and will no doubt often be
wrong, but hopefully only on the way to being more right.
